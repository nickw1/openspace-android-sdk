OS OpenSpace Android SDK
=======

PLEASE NOTE - this is a FORK of the original OS OpenSpace Android SDK available at https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/openspace-android-sdk. It was forked on 11/6/18 by Nick Whitelegg (nickw on OSM). The aim is to produce an SDK that will work with custom tileservers using the OSGB projection, for example a custom VectorMap District tileserver.

This fork contains an Android Studio library project and produces an AAR file, so should be easy to integrate with contemporary Android Studio projects.

To summarise the initial changes.
* Several classes and methods have been made public to allow a custom tileserver to use. Please see comments in the source files.

Original documentation
-------
The openspace-android-sdk enables access to [Ordnance Survey](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/web-services/) Web Map Tile Services (WMTS) for Android devices. It provides access to a number of mapping layers and gazetteer lookups and has a similar API to Google Maps API v2, so that moving from Google mapping to Ordnance Survey mapping is simple, see [Converting](#converting-google-maps).

This SDK is available as a static framework, see the [Getting started](#getting-started) guide for instructions about downloading and importing into your own application or try a [demo app](#demo-projects) to get started quickly.

### Download framework package

The latest openspace-android-sdk package is available to [download](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-openspace/android-sdk.html) from Ordnance Survey.

Unzip the downloaded file to reveal the SDK `.jar` and then import into your project.


### Import into Android project

The openspace-android-sdk `.jar` can be imported into an Android project similar to any other library.

For example, you can add the openspace-android-sdk to your project buildpath using your IDE.

If you are using a build tool for your Android project such as Maven or Gradle the openspace-android-sdk can be added as a local dependancy.

The openspace-android-sdk resides in the `uk.co.ordnancesurvey.android.maps` namespace.

##### Gradle

Add a openspace-android-sdk dependancy to the compile configuration with the library installed in the `libs` directory.

```groovy

dependencies {

	//...
	
	// require openspace-android-sdk library
    compile files('libs/osmapandroid-1.jar')

}

```

##### Maven

Use Maven system scope and systemPath to add a local dependancy to the openspace-android-sdk installed in the `libs` directory.

```xml

<dependency>
	<groupId>uk.co.ordnancesurvey</groupId>
	<artifactId>osmapandroid</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0</version>
	<scope>system</scope>
	<systemPath>${project.basedir}/libs/osmapandroid-1.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>

```


### Dependancies & requirements

##### Android Support Library v4

The openspace-android-sdk requires the Android Support Library v4 but does not include it, please provide an instance from your application.


##### OpenGL ES 2.0

The openspace-android-sdk uses OpenGL ES 2.0 to render the map, please specify this feature in `AndroidManifest.xml` as below.

```xml

<!-- Use OpenGL ES 2.0 -->
<uses-feature
    android:glEsVersion="0x00020000"
    android:required="true" />

```

##### Permissions

Depending on the features used, request the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`.

* `android.permission.INTERNET` is required when accessing online services.
* `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` is required to check whether data can be downloaded.
* `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is required to cache map tile images.
* `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` and `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` are required to receive accurate device location data.


```xml

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />

```


### Displaying a map

The simplest method of displaying a map is to add a MapFragment to your activity, for example add the code below to the xml configuration for the activity.

```xml

<fragment
    android:id="@+id/map_fragment"
    android:name="uk.co.ordnancesurvey.android.maps.MapFragment"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
    
```

The OSMap fragment cannot be initialised on its own and requries a TileSource in order to access content either online or offline.

Open the respective Java class accompanying the activity xml and add an `OSTileSource` to the OSMap instance, in this example we create a new WebTileSource that accesses the online OS OpenSpace service with an API key.

```java

//add to onCreate implementation

MapFragment mapFragment = ((MapFragment) getFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.map_fragment));

OSMap mMap = mapFragment.getMap();

//create list of tileSources
ArrayList<OSTileSource> sources = new ArrayList<OSTileSource>();

//create web tile source with API details
sources.add( mMap.webTileSource( "API_KEY", true/false, null ) );
mMap.setTileSources(sources);

```


### Product Codes

A developer can select which Ordnance Survey mapping products to use by  selecting customising their app by passing the product codes as and array of strings.

By default the openspace-android-sdk will use the default set of products below.

```java

//default stack
{"SV","SVR","50K","50KR","250K","250KR","MS","MSR","OV2","OV1","OV0"}

```

To customise the products in use, use the `OSMapOptions` class and pass an array of product codes when intantiating a `MapFragment` or `SupportMapFragment`.


```java

String[] freeProductsWithVmd = new String[] { "SV","SVR", "VMD", "VMDR","50K","50KR","250K","250KR","MS","MSR","OV2","OV1","OV0" };

OSMapOptions options = new OSMapOptions().products(freeProductsWithVmd);

MapFragment mapFragment = new MapFragment(options);

```

If you wish to restrict the products displayed per tile source then pass in this array of products when creating a tile source.

```java

OSMap mMap = //get OSMap instance

String[] overviewMappingLayers = new String[] { "MS","MSR","OV2","OV1","OV0" };

OSTileSource overviewMappingSource = mMap.webTileSource("API_KEY", false, overviewMappingLayers);

```


**NOTE:**

* Certain products and the Zoom map stack require a commercial licence.

### Converting Google Maps

The openspace-android-sdk has a largely similar API to Google Maps API v2 and so an existing project can be converted to use Ordnance Survey mapping easily.

1) Replace any layout XML elements with the openspace-android-sdk equivalent namespace.

For example replace `com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment` with `uk.co.ordnancesurvey.android.maps.MapFragment`.

2) Replace any instances of Google Maps API classes with the openspace-android-sdk equivalent classes.

For example replace instances of `GoogleMap` with `OSMap`.

3) Complete initialisation of `OSMap` by supplying a `OSTileSource` pointing to an offline or online with API Key tile source.

4) Replace or translate any Google Maps API vector instances with the openspace-android-sdk equivalent.

For example a `LatLng` can be converted to a `GridPoint`.

**NOTE:**

* Depending on the complexity of your application there may be further steps necessary to convert an existing project to openspace-android-sdk
* License terms and conditions applied to some data sources and services may prohibit display on other mapping frameworks than Google Maps. Please refer to terms and conditions for further details. 


### Versioning

Ordnance Survey will provide and offically support the latest version of the SDK.


API
-------

In this section we will run through some of the important components in the SDK. For more details please see the [reference documentation](http://ordnancesurvey.github.io/openspace-android-sdk/) or any [demo app](#demo-projects) for full application usage. The API is largely similar to Google Maps Android V2 and so much of the documentation can apply to this SDK.


### OS Map (`OSMap` class)

This is the main class to interact with the map, it provides access to configure and manipulate the map. You cannot instantiate this class, to access it call the `getMap()` method on the `MapFragment` or `MapView` depending on how you are using the SDK in your application.

**NOTE:**

* The `OSMap` class can only be read or modified from the main thread.
* The `OSMap` must be configured with a tile source - see Tilesources below.
* `OSMap` does not support drawing maps outside Great Britain.
* The `OSMap` does not support other Map Types than the standard 2D map, however it does support rendering different Ordnance Survey products.

**DEMO**

See any of the [demo projects](#demo-projects) for working examples

### OS MapFragment (`MapFragment` class)

The `MapFragment` is a container for the `OSMap`, this is the simplest way of using the SDK in your application as it will initialise the Map and the view and handles the lifecycle requirements.

Configure a MapFragment in an activity, for example add the code below to the xml configuration for the activity.

**NOTE:**

* Use `MapFragment` class if you are targeting API level 11 and above otherwise use the `SupportMapFragment` along with the Android support library.

```xml

<fragment
    android:id="@+id/map_fragment"
    android:name="uk.co.ordnancesurvey.android.maps.MapFragment"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
    
```

Use the `getMap()` method on `MapFragment` to obtain instance of `OSMap`.


```java

MapFragment mapFragment = ((MapFragment) getFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.map_fragment));

//obtain instance of OSMap from SupportMapFragment
OSMap mMap = mapFragment.getMap();

//configure OSMap...

```

### OS SupportMapFragment (`SupportMapFragment` class)

The `SupportMapFragment` is again, as the `MapFragment` above but necessary if tageting below API level 11 along with the Android support library.


**NOTE:**

* To use openspace-android-sdk you must provide the Android support library in your build path.


```xml

<fragment
    android:id="@+id/map_fragment"
    android:name="uk.co.ordnancesurvey.android.maps.SupportMapFragment"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
    
```

Use the `getMap()` method on `MapFragment` to obtain instance of `OSMap`.


```java

android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager fragmentMgr = getSupportFragmentManager();
SupportMapFragment mapFragment = (SupportMapFragment) fragmentMgr.findFragmentById(R.id.map_fragment);

OSMap mMap = mapFragment.getMap();

//configure OSMap...

```

### Tilesources (`OSTileSource` class)

The `OSMap` class requires atleast one online or offline tile source to render a map.

The offline tilesources must be present on the file system in the form of `ostiles` packages. Using online tilesources requires an API key.

```java

OSMap mMap = //get OSMap instance

//create a Collection to hold tile sources
ArrayList<OSTileSource> sources = new ArrayList<OSTileSource>();

// Load all ".ostiles" files from the SD card.
sources.addAll(mMap.localTileSourcesInDirectory(this, Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()));

// Fall back to a web tile source.
sources.add(mMap.webTileSource("API_KEY", false, null));

//  Tile sources are consulted in the order they appear in the array
mMap.setTileSources(sources);


```


**NOTE:**

* To configure product codes, see the [products available](#product-codes) section.


### Markers (`Marker` & `MarkerOptions` classes)

Markers identify single point locations on the map and can be interacted with in the form of touch events and info windows.

To customise the `Marker` appearance and behaviour, the `addMarker` method accepts a configuration object `MarkerOptions`, use this class to alter how the marker behaves and users interact with it.


Add a `Marker` to the map with options.

```java

OSMap mMap = //get OSMap instance

Marker marker = mMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions()
            .gridPoint(new GridPoint(260899, 354314))
            .title("Snowdon summit")
            .snippet("Congratulations! If you make it to this point, you can always get the train down."));

```


It is possible to respond to touch events from markers, this interaction is done through the `OSMap` class by registering a listener for the callback you are interested in.

To respond to a Marker click event, pass an `OnMarkerClickListener` to the `OSMap` using the `OSMap.setOnMarkerClickListener` method to receive a callback when a user clicks on a marker. Return a boolean to indicate if you have consumed the event and if you want to suppress the default action.

The `OnMarkerDragListener` interface will allow you to receive callbacks for the events surrounding a marker being dragged, the `onMarkerDragStart`, `onMarkerDragEnd` and `onMarkerDrag` methods encapsulate the start, finish and during the drag event. To use an `OnMarkerDragListener` pass to the map using the `OSMap.setOnMarkerDragListener` method.

It is possible to customise info windows by implementing an `InfoWindowAdapter` and using the `OSMap.setInfoWindowAdapter` to pass to the map. This `InfoWindowAdapter` can return a `android.view.View` for either the entire info window (`getInfoWindow`) or just the contents (`getInfoContents`).  To receive callbacks for when an info window is clicked, create an `OnInfoWindowClickListener` and pass to the map using the method `OSMap.setOnInfoWindowClickListener`.


### Shapes

The set of Shapes available allow a wide range of overlays to be applied to the map along with customisation.

The pattern is similar to Markers above, customise the `*Options` object before creating the shape and adding to the map. Similarly the option object requires some geometry to specify the position and extent of the shape on the map.

In the example below we create a square `Polygon` and style it.

```java

OSMap mMap = //get OSMap instance

final GridPoint sw = new GridPoint(437200, 115450);

PolygonOptions rectOptions = new PolygonOptions()
        .add(sw,
             new GridPoint(sw.x, sw.y + 200),
             new GridPoint(sw.x + 200, sw.y + 200),
             new GridPoint(sw.x + 200, sw.y))
        .strokeColor(Color.GREEN)
        .fillColor(0x7F00FF00);

Polygon polygon = mMap.addPolygon(rectOptions);

```

There are existing SDK classes for the following shapes, please see reference documentation for more details:

* Polygon - without interior polygons
* Polyline
* Circle


### Geocoding (`Geocoder` class)

The `Geocoder` class provides offline search facility against the following datasets; 

* [1:50 000 Scale Gazetteer](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/50k-gazetteer/index.html) - Place names
* [Code-Point Open](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/code-point-open/index.html) - Post codes
* [OS Locator](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/os-locator/index.html) - Road names
* Grid Reference

Along with online search facility against the following datasets; 

* [1:50 000 Scale Gazetteer](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/50k-gazetteer/index.html) - Place names
* [Code-Point Open](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/code-point-open/index.html) - Post codes

The `Geocoder` can be created using either an offline database, online API key details or both; just pass in `null` for the parameters that are not used. For example, to create an online only `Geocoder` just pass in an API key.

```java

File poiDatabase = //get reference to .ospoi database

Geocoder geocoder = new Geocoder(poiDatabase, "API_Key", getApplicationContext(), false);

```


The product to search is determined by passing a `Geocoder.GeocodeType` into the `Geocoder.geocodeString(String s, GeocodeType geocodeType, GridRect boundingRect, int start, int numResults)` method. For simplicity you can use `Geocoder.GeocodeType.allOffline()` or `Geocoder.GeocodeType.allOnline()` or simply select a `Geocoder.GeocodeType` individually.

Offline searches can be performed within an area by passing a `GridRect`, to search the entire country pass in `null`.

The number of results can be limited by specifying the number (and offset) of results to return. This will be applied individually to each type of search. To return ALL results, set `numResults` to 0.

The `Geocoder` returns a `Results` object that contains a list of `Placemark` as the matched resultset and a list of `GeocodeException` if any. For example, you may retrieve the list of matches as below;

```java

Results results = //perform Geocoder search

List<? extends Placemark> placemarks = results.getPlacemarks()

```

**NOTE:**

* The `Geocoder` class can work with an offline database - See [offline places of interest gazetteer database](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/openspace-sdk-resources#places-of-interest-geocoder-database) 
* The online access requires an API key configured
* There are currently no reverse geocoding facilities

### Geometry

The SDK provides an implementation to translate between ubiquitous WGS84 coordinate system used in many systems include the GPS network and British National Grid.

The SDK class `GridPoint` represents OSGB36 British National Grid easting/northing.

Conversion between WGS84 and `GridPoint` can be performed with the SDK and the `MapProjection` class — applications should not perform unnecessary conversions. Coordinates should be stored in their source coordinate system in order to benefit from future accuracy improvements within the SDK. 

Conversions can be performed via this SDK if required using the functions below;


```java

//grab the default MapProjection in use
MapProjection mapProjection = MapProjection.getDefault();

//convert my WGS84 lat, lng in decimal degress to a GridPoint object in OSGB36
GridPoint gridPointFromLatLng = mapProjection.toGridPoint(50.937773, -1.470603);

//create an array to hold the returned 2D point; convert the OSGB36 GridPoint to WGS84(x, y)
double[] latLng2d = new double[2];
mapProjection.fromGridPoint(new GridPoint(437294, 115504), latLng2d);


``` 

The class `GridRect` exists as a representation of a rectangular region on the OS Map.

```java

GridRect su30GridSquare = new GridRect(430000, 100000, 440000, 110000);

```

**NOTE:**

* The Google Maps API class `LatLng` is not used in this SDK.

### User location

The SDK provides a wrapper around standard Location services API to allow your application to display the device location easily.

When enabled, a distinct annotation will be added to the map complete with estimated GPS accuracy display in the form of a circle around the annotation, a large circle represents a low accuracy and large margin of error in determining the device location.


To start or stop receiving updates, calling the `mMap.setMyLocationEnabled` method:

```java

OSMap mMap = //get OSMap instance

mMap.setMyLocationEnabled(true);

```

Now you can access the current location of the device or pass an `OnMyLocationChangeListener` to the SDK to receive updates when the location changes using the `OSMap.setOnMyLocationChangeListener` method.


```java

OSMap mMap = //get OSMap instance

GridPoint myGridPoint = mMap.getMyGridPoint();

Location myLocation = mMap.getMyLocation();

```

**NOTE:**

* To enable this you must specify the correct permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` as below.

```xml

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />

```
