/**
 * A Map component in an app. This fragment is the simplest way to place a map in an application. It's a wrapper around a view of a map 
 * to automatically handle the necessary life cycle needs. Being a fragment, this component can be added to an activity's layout file 
 * simply with the XML below.
 * <code>
&lt;fragment
    class="uk.co.ordnancesurvey.android.maps.MapFragment"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"/&gt;
    * </code>
    * <p>
    * An {@link OSMap} can only be acquired using {@link #getMap()} when the underlying maps system is loaded and the underlying 
    * view in the fragment exists. This class automatically initializes the maps system and the view. If an {@link OSMap}
    *  is not available, {@link #getMap()} will return null.
    * <p>
    * A view can be removed when the MapFragment's {@link #onDestroyView()} method is called. When this happens the MapFragment 
    * is no longer valid until the view is recreated again later when MapFragment's onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle) 
    * method is called.
    * <p>
    * Any objects obtained from the {@link OSMap} are associated with the view. It's important to not hold on to objects
    *  (e.g. {@link Marker}) beyond the view's life. Otherwise it will cause a memory leak as the view cannot be released.
    * <p>
    * Use this class only if you are targeting API 11 and above. Otherwise, use SupportMapFragment.
